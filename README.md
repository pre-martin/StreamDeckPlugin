# Stream Deck SimHub Plugin


## About

This is a plugin for [Stream Deck](https://www.elgato.com/stream-deck). It offers Stream Deck actions, which are updating their state from [SimHub](https://www.simhubdash.com/).

This means, that actions can be bound to SimHub properties. If the value of a bound SimHub property changes, the button in Stream Deck will reflect this property change.

This plugin depends on the [SimHub Property Server plugin](https://github.com/pre-martin/SimHubPropertyServer), which has to be installed in SimHub.


## Installation

Be sure to have the SimHub Property Server plugin installed into SimHub (see above). When updating this plugin, be sure to also check the SimHub Property Server plugin for updates.

For the usage of this plugin, the [.NET Runtime 6.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0) has to be installed. It is very likely, that this is already installed in your PC.

Download the file `net.planetrenner.simhub.streamDeckPlugin` from the GitHub "Releases" page and double-click it to install it into Stream Deck.
