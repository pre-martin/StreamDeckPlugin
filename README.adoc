= Stream Deck SimHub Plugin
:toc:


== About

This is a plugin for https://www.elgato.com/stream-deck[Stream Deck]. It offers Stream Deck actions, which are updating their state from https://www.simhubdash.com/[SimHub].

This means, that actions can be bound to SimHub properties. If the value of a bound SimHub property changes, the button in Stream Deck will reflect this property change.

This plugin depends on the https://github.com/pre-martin/SimHubPropertyServer[SimHub Property Server plugin], which has to be installed in SimHub.

In the screenshot below, icons are green because they are "on" in the simulation or in SimHub.
